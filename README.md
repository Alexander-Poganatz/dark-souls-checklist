# dark-souls-checklist

Just some data for a dark souls checklist app I made.
It doesn't have bootstrap, jquery, and the upper index file 
from my main site.

I put the darksoulsdatahandler.js in the knights honor folder
because the knights honor achievement is what I started with.

The ItemAndDescriptionToJavaScript is just a program to convert a list in a text file to a javascript file with json.

The lists folder contains text files of the data for the app.
